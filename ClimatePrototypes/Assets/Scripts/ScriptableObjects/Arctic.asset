  - Hello, welcome to the Arctic!
  - Use the A|D Keys or the Left|Right Arrow Keys to move your paddle!
  - Block incoming solar radiation (orange) and avoid longwave radiation (purple).

  - Welcome back to the Arctic!
  - As the temperature increases, brighter clouds may reflect more solar radiation.
  - Higher temperatures also mean that the ice you are protecting starts damaged,
    and you have a smaller paddle.
